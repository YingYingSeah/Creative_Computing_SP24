    "Write a program that asks the user to input and store at least 5 famous quotes along with its author name in a file named ‘quotes.txt’. Then, using the file ‘quotes.txt’, the program should generate a random quote of the day from the list of famous quotes stored that file. Print the randomly selected quote AND write the quote in a file named ‘daily_quotes.txt’. The existing content in the file ‘daily_quotes.txt’ should not be wiped every time you add new quotes.\n",
